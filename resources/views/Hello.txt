Hello

Our company is in search of talented blockchain developers with strong knowledge of Rust and Webassembly to extend our team. We have multiple opportunities across several projects that involve building a variety of custom smart contracts on top of a WASM ecosystem.

Ongoing work includes:
* Development of REST APIs
* Token Standards Design
* Blockchain-based services leveraging:
---Smart contracts (WASM and Solidity)
---Decentralized finance (DeFi)
---NFTs
---Digital identifiers (DIDs),
---ZKPs

Good knowledge of GOlang and Solidity is a plus.

We are searching for a person who can work under self-supervision, problem solve, and likes to design novel solutions to interesting technical and real world problems.

There are opportunities for both short and longer-term projects.

Could you please let me know if you're interested and available for a short technical interview?

We are looking to start onboarding developers to projects in early May.
